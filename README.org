* Why Reproducible Research?
  
** Why here?!
   - A lot of computational results in the /computer science research/
   - A noticeable amount of graduate research endeavor is wasted reproducing other people's results

** Why Reproducible Research at all?!
   Claerbout Principle
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   An article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual
   scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that reproduce the result.

    - Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in 2010
    - Computations done in *Excel*!
    - Published in "The American Economic Review"
      #+REVEAL: split
    Made great economical influence...

    Was totally *wrong*!

*** Consequences
     As a consequence, people started asking whether it is appropriate
 to cite scientific research in politics and economical decisions.

*** The American Psychology Association
    Two related studies in 2006 and 2015 asked the authors of /APA/ for data. The following
    table summarizes their response.
    | Year | Data Response | Number of Contacted Authors |
    |------+---------------+-----------------------------|
    | 2006 |           27% |                         141 |
    | 2015 |           38% |                         394 |
    #+REVEAL: split
    In another 2015 study, 270 researchers collaborated
    trying to reproduce the results published in the top psychology journals.

    Less than half were reproducible.
*** Cancer Research
    - Amgen team, 2012, tried to reproduce important results of pre-clinical targets of cancer
    - 47 out of 53 (88.6%) were "irreproducible"

* What is the solution?!
  Computational research, including statistical studies need to 
  be reproducible from source.
  
** Definition
   *Reproducible research* is the idea that scientific claims are published with:
   1. their data
   2. software code used to analyze them
      
* The Platform
  The platform needs to perform 3 tasks:
  - document computation workflow
  - integrate text, math, and code
  - produce or modify a figure
** Available tools
   - Knitr (R)
   - +IPython+ (Python, Julia, Haskell, Ruby)
   - *Jupyter* (multi-language)
   - *org-mode* (multi-language)
** Jupyter
   Jupyter is an "Web-based Publishing" platform.

*** [Demo]
** org-mode
   org-mode is an Emacs plugin, for todo management, and easy publishing.
   
   Org supports all the 3 features mentioned above for a long list of languages, capable of exporting to ${  \LaTeX  }$
   and use of all ${ \LaTeX }$ commands and packages.
   
   Plus, org has features for moving data between different programming languages, in addition to it's native tables.
** Source code example
   $$ \int _0^1 e^{e^x} dx $$
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both :cache yes
     from random import random
     import math

     def approx(total):
         succ = 0
         for i in range(total):
             x, y = random(), random() * 27
             if y < math.exp(math.exp(x)):
                 succ += 1
         return (succ/total) * 27

     print(approx(10000000))

* Best Practice
** Automate data manipulation from source
** Don't modify figures/diagrams manually
** Always use a pre-determined /seed/ for random number generators
